\begin{abstract}
  This study investigates the usability and user preferences between two types of instruction sets: gaze-activated and touch-activated interactions. Through a VR space flight simulation, participants will be randomly assigned to one of these instruction methods to learn and navigate a semi-complex control system. The research will evaluate user performance, ease of learning, and overall preference to determine which method provides a more intuitive experience. By examining multimodal interaction within a controlled VR setting, this study aims to contribute to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and inform future VR interface designs. Findings from this research may offer insights into optimizing instruction delivery in games, training simulations, and other immersive applications.
